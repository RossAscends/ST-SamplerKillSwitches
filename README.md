# ST-SamplerKillSwitches

Adds a killswitch to every sampler, so you can prevent them from even getting sent into the API Call.

The top-most killswitch on the sampler panel will toggle all switches at the same time.

Certain samplers already have their own native killswitched (DynaTemp, Banned Strings/Tokens), so those did not get new ones. 

Currently does not save state between sessions!

Todo: 
- add state saving
- figure out why the BannedStrings killswitch gets reversed when using the Master Kill Switch
